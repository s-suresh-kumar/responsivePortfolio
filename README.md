# responsivePortfolio
Purpose: Use Bootstrap CSS framework to design a mobile responsive portfolio.

Design:
The ResponsivePortfolio has 3 pages index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

The home page index.html has a brief bio about me, includes my picture, has professional social media links to learn more about my work. ( linkedin, stackoverflow and github).

The porfolio page has links to the projects that are implemented as part of my portfolio.  Some of the projects are under construction and expected to be present there with proper links.  Already implemented projects such as refactor and responsivePortfolio are properly linked to the live pages, so by clicking on them, it will take them to respective home pages of the projects.

The contact page helps to send message to me and has input fields such as Name , e-mail and text area.

All 3 pages are designed using responsive bootstrap 4 layouts and compoents so pages are responsive to screen size changes and work well on all viewport sizes and devices.
